# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, data breach potential, geospatial data exposure
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, API key exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, resource exhaustion
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### Multi-Technology Stack Security
- **Rust:** Memory safety, secure compilation, dependency auditing with cargo-audit
- **TypeScript/Node.js:** Type safety, dependency scanning, secure coding practices
- **Python:** Virtual environment isolation, dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Docker:** Container security, image scanning, non-root execution

### Geospatial Data Security
- Secure handling of location-sensitive data
- Data anonymization and privacy protection
- Access controls for geographic information
- Secure data transmission and storage
- Compliance with geospatial data regulations
- Map tile server security

### BIM Integration Security
- Secure CAD/BIM file processing
- Input validation for 3D model data
- File upload sanitization and validation
- Resource limits for model processing
- Secure model viewer implementation
- Intellectual property protection

### Dashboard Security
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Session management and CSRF protection
- Input validation on all form fields
- XSS prevention in data visualization
- Secure API endpoint implementation
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

3. **Monitoring:** Unusual data access patterns or resource usage

### Response
1. **Assess:** Determine severity and data impact
2. **Contain:** Isolate affected components and data
3. **Investigate:** Forensic analysis and data audit
4. **Remediate:** Apply fixes and security patches
5. **Recover:** Restore normal operations
6. **Learn:** Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Audits

### Regular Security Reviews
- **Code Review:** Every pull request across all languages
- **Dependency Scan:** Weekly across all package managers
- **Container Scan:** On every Docker build
- **Data Security Review:** Monthly geospatial data audit

### Last Security Audit
