# Global Health Model Terrain Data

This directory contains terrain data specifically for the Global Health Model visualization on port 8083.

This can be different terrain data than the main terrain server, allowing you to:
- Use higher resolution terrain for specific regions
- Load custom terrain for areas of interest
- Separate development/testing terrain from production

See ../terrain/README.md for the expected file structure.
